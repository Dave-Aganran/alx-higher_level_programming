# If/else, loops, functions
Project done during **Software Engineering studies** at **ALX**. The project aims to learn about if/else statements, loops, range and functions in **Python**.

## Technologies
* Shell Scripts are written in Bash
* Python Scripts are written with Python
* C files are compiled using `gcc`
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
